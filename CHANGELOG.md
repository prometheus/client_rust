## [0.23.0] - unreleased

### Changed

  See [PR 198].

[PR 198]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/198

### Added

  See [PR 173] and [PR 216].

[PR 173]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/173
[PR 216]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/216

## [0.22.3]

### Added

  See [PR 205].

  [PR 205]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/205

- Support all platforms with 32 bit atomics lacking 64 bit atomics.
  See [PR 203].

[PR 203]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/203

## [0.22.2]

### Added

  See [PR 191].

[PR 191]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/191

## [0.22.1]

### Added

- Added `EncodeLabelValue` and `EncodeLabelKey` implementations for `Arc`,
  `Rc`, and `Box`.
  See [PR 188].

[PR 188]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/188

## [0.22.0]

### Changed

- Simplify `Collector` `trait` by enabling `Collector::collect` to encode metrics directly with a `DescriptorEncoder`.
  See [PR 149] for details.

[PR 149]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/149

## [0.21.2]

### Added

- Added `sub_registry_with_labels` method to `Registry`.
  See [PR 145].
- Added `with_labels` and `with_prefix_and_labels` constructors to `Registry`.
  See [PR 147].

[PR 145]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/145
[PR 147]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/147

## [0.21.1]

### Added

- Implement `EncodeLabelValue` for `Option<T>`.
  See [PR 137].

[PR 137]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/137

## [0.21.0]

### Changed

- Replace `impl EncodeMetric for RefCell<T>` with a new type `ConstFamily` implementing `EncodeMetric`.

## [0.20.0]

### Added

- Introduce `Collector` abstraction allowing users to provide additional metrics
  and their description on each scrape. See [PR 82].

- Introduce a `#[prometheus(flatten)]` attribute which can be used when deriving `EncodeLabelSet`, allowing
  a nested struct to be flattened during encoding. See [PR 118].

  For example:

  ```rust
  #[derive(EncodeLabelSet, Hash, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
  struct CommonLabels {
      a: u64,
      b: u64,
  }
  #[derive(EncodeLabelSet, Hash, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
  struct Labels {
      unique: u64,
      #[prometheus(flatten)]
      common: CommonLabels,
  }
  ```

  Would be encoded as:

  ```
  my_metric{a="42",b="42",unique="42"} 42
  ```

### Fixed

- Fix label encoding in protobuf feature. See [PR 123].

[PR 82]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/82
[PR 118]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/118
[PR 123]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/123

## [0.19.0]

This is a large release including multiple breaking changes. Major user-facing
improvement of this release is support for the OpenMetrics Protobuf format.

### Upgrade guide:

- Don't box before registering.

  ```diff
    registry.register(
        "my_metric",
        "This is my metric",
  -      Box::new(my_metric.clone()),
  +      my_metric.clone(),
    );
  ```

- Gauge uses `i64` instead of `u64`.

  ```diff
    my_gauge
  -     .set(42u64);
  +     .set(42i64);
  ```

- Derive `EncodeLabelSet` for `struct` and `EncodeLabelValue` for `enum` instead of just `Encode` for all and require `Debug`.

  ```diff
  - #[derive(Clone, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Encode)]
  + #[derive(Clone, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, EncodeLabelSet, Debug)]
    struct Labels {
        path: String,
        method: Method,
        some_number: u64,
    }

  - #[derive(Clone, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Encode)]
  + #[derive(Clone, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, EncodeLabelValue, Debug)]
    enum Method {
        Get,
        #[allow(dead_code)]
        Put,
    }
  ```

- Encode as utf-8 and not as `[u8]`.

  ```diff
  - let mut buffer = vec![];
  + let mut buffer = String::new();
    encode(&mut buffer, &registry).unwrap();
  ```

For details on each of these, see changelog entries below.

### Added

- Added support for the OpenMetrics protobuf format. See [PR 83].
- Added a `remove` method to `Family` to allow the removal of a specified label
  set from a family. See [PR 85].
- Added a `clear` method to `Family` to allow the removal of all label sets
  from a family. See [PR 85].
- Impl `TypedMetric` for `CounterWithExemplar` and `HistogramWithExemplar`, so that they can be used with `Family`. See [PR 96].

### Changed

- Always use dynamic dispatch on `Registry`, i.e. remove generic type parameter `M` from `Registry`. See [PR 105].
- Refactor encoding. See [PR 105].
  - Introducing separate traits to encode
    - value (e.g. `EncodeCounterValue`)
    - label set (`EncodeLabelSet`), derivable for structs via `prometheus-client-derive-encode`
    - label (`EncodeLabel`)
    - label key (`EncodeLabelKey`)
    - label value (`EncodeLabelValue`), derivable for enums via `prometheus-client-derive-encode`
  - Encode as UTF-8 strings, not bytes. I.e. use `std::fmt::Write` instead of `std::io::Write`.
- Use signed integers for `Gauge` for compliance with OpenMetrics protobuf
  format. See [PR 105].

[PR 83]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/83
[PR 85]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/85
[PR 96]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/96
[PR 105]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/105

## [0.18.1]

### Fixed

- Fix race condition in `Family::get_or_create`. See [PR 102].

[PR 102]: https://github.com/prometheus/client_rust/pull/102

## [0.18.0]

### Changed

- Use `parking_lot` instead of `std::sync::*`.

  Before `proemtheus-client` would use the `owning_ref` crate to map the target
  of a `std::sync::RwLockReadGuard`. `owning_ref` has multiple unsoundness
  issues, see https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0040.html. Instead of
  replacing `owning_ref` with a similar crate, we switch to locking via
  `parking_lot` which supports the above mapping natively.

  See [PR 78] and [issue 77].

### Removed
- Remove `Add` trait implementation for a private type which lead to compile time conflicts with existing `Add` implementations e.g. on `String`. See [PR 69].
